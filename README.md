- 👋 Hi, I’m @DavidSupina
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, board games, Catholicism and philosophy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# (or more accurately, relearning it), as well as a number of computer science and computer science adjacent topics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on perhaps more in the future, but I'm just looking to learn for now.
- 📫 How to reach me ... email me at davidsupina@gmail.com.
